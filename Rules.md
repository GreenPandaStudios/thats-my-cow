# Welcome to the Cow Game, Cowperson!

Each player is trying to build the biggest heard of cows before reaching your destination. This app is not responsible for broken friendships, hurt feelings, or physical injuries. Play responsibly and drive safe.

## There are 3 main actions:

### That's My Cow!

A cow can be claimed from a single cow or a group or herd of cows. Only one player can claim this single cow or herd/group of cows. If there is a single farm but multiple groups or pockets of cows that can be distringuished, these can be claimed as separate cows. Only one person can claim each single cow or group/herd. They must do so by being the first to say "That's my cow!" and **MUST** say these words clearly and exactly or it doesn't count. You must be sure it is a cow before claiming - no other animals or mysterious dark shapes!

### Marry My Cows!

If you see a church (or other place of religious worship) you must clearly and exactly say "Marry my cows!". This doubles your cows. These buildings can only be claimed by one player.

### Kill Your Cows!

If you see a cemetery (or, arguably, a crematorium), you must clearly and exactly say "Kill your cows!" and then choose just one person's cows to kill. This eliminates half of their cows (rounded up if odd). These can only be claimed by one player.

## Additional Rules:

- Pictures or drawings of cows do not count, however, statues of cows do (must be 3 dimensional)!
- Signs for churches, cemetaries, or dairy farms do not count.
- If you know there is a building full of cows, but do not see one with your eyes, you CANNOT make a claim!
- The game relies on honesty (though a referee may need to be appointed if you distrust your competitors...)

The game ends when the car comes to a stop, and the player with the most cows wins. However, you may choose to play on if you wish!

And remember... **no mercy!**
