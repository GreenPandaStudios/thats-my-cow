# The Cow Game

In this game, you build up your herd of cows. You can grow your herd in three main ways:

1. **Claiming Cows**: When you see a valid \"Cow,\" the first person to say **EXACTLY**:

   > \"That's My Cow\"  
   > adds that cow to their herd.
   > _(Note: A cow can only be claimed by one player and only once per car ride.)_

2. **Marrying Cows**: When you see a church, the first person to say **EXACTLY**:

   > \"Marry My Cows\"  
   > immediately DOUBLES the size of their herd.  
   > _(Note: A church can only be claimed by one player and only once per car ride.)_

3. **Killing Cows**: When you see a cemetery, the first person to say **EXACTLY**:
   > \"Kill Your Cows\"  
   > chooses another player to lose half of their herd.  
   > _(Note: A cemetery can only be claimed by one player and only once per car ride.)_
